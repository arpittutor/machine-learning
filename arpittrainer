It uses certain statistical algorithms to make computers work in a certain way without being explicitly programmed. The algorithms receive an input value and predict an output for this by the use of certain statistical methods. The main aim of machine learning is to create intelligent machines which can think and work like human beings. Machine learning is a sub field of AI, in which a computer system is fed with algorithms that are designed to analyze & interpret different types of data on their own. These learning algorithms obtain the analyzing ability when they are trained for the same using sample data.
